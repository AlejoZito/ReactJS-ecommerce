# Coder Commerce

This e-shop project was developed in react as a final challenge for the [ReactJs course at CoderHouse](https://www.coderhouse.com/online/reactjs)
It features a list view that can be filtered by categories, a detail view and a cart/checkout view. The project is connected to firestore for data persistence
